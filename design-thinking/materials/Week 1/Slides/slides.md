## What is data visualization?

*In its most basic form, visualization is simply mapping data to geometry and color* (Yau, 2013, p. 93).

Notes:

- Way to translate data or real life to graphics or visual representations

---

### Why Data Visualization?

* Mental processing speed
* Discovery of patterns
* Distillation of large datasets

<!-- .slide: class="processing-speed" data-state="processing-speed" -->

<style>
    .processing-speed table { margin-left: 0; }
    .processing-speed table, 
    .processing-speed .viz {
        float:left;
    } 
    .processing-speed .viz { margin: 50px; };
</style>

### Mental Processing Speed

What year had the highest sales?

| Year | Sales |
| ---- | ----- |
| 2000 | $45   |
| 2001 | $56   |
| 2002 | $36   |
| 2003 | $58   |
| 2004 | $75   |
| 2005 | $62   |

<div class="viz"></div>

Notes:

* Immediately obvious from the graph which was highest

<!-- .slide: class="pattern-discovery" data-state="pattern-discovery" -->

<style>
    .pattern-discovery .img {
        float:left;
        width:40%;
        margin:5%;
        border:none;
    }
</style>

### Pattern Discovery

Notes:

### How can we conceptualize data?
#### Long vs. wide data

---

In *Tidy Data (2014)*, Hadley Wickham lays out the benefits of tidy data and how to use it.

#### Wide data: Untidy data set
|         | ScenarioA | ScenarioB |
| ----    | -----     | -----     |
| Kim     | 18        | 2         |
| John    | 38        | 5         |
| Ellen   | 10        | 29        |
| Marcus  | 17        | 15        |

Notes:

- Article is written from the perspective of a data scientists using R
- Goal of paper is to propose a set of standards of how to tidy data for data processing, analyzing, and visualizing
- Typical data set you might get
- Each different 

---

#### Long data: tidy data set
|  Name   | Scenario | Result |
| ----    | -----    | -----  |
| Kim     | A        | 18     |
| John    | A        | 38     |
| Ellen   | A        | 10     |
| Marcus  | A        | 17     |
| Kim     | B        | 2      |
| John    | B        | 5      |
| Ellen   | B        | 29     |
| Marcus  | B        | 15     |

Notes:
- Tidy data sets enable us to draw a connection between the physical structure of data and with the metrics we'd be interested in visualizing
- Here every value belongs to a variable (column) and observation (row)
- The table structure helps us to assign variables to axes and identify which visual graphics we want to map to the data

---

### Ways to tidy up messy data

- Column headers are variables and not values
- Each column contains on variable
- Observations constitue a row, variables a column
- Multiple types of observations are stored in one table, and vice versa

===

## Using dimensions

Notes:

* Once you identify which metrics you'd like to visual, it's time to consider how you'll visually do that

---

#### What are dimensions?

In *Semiology of Graphics (1967)*, Jacques Bertin presented the following dimensions as "visual variables":

* Position
* Size
* Shape
* Value (lightness)
* Color hue
* Orientation
* Texture

Notes:

* Visual representation of quantitative values in a graphic

---

In *Data Points: Visualization That Means Something (2013)*, Nathan Yau presented the following dimensions as "visual cues":

* Position
* Length
* Angle
* Direction
* Shapes
* Area
* Volume
* Color saturation
* Color hue

---

### Not all dimensions are created equal

* Preattentive attributes: those that are distinguishable and comparable at first glance, without any thinking or specific attention
  * Length
  * Color

Notes:

* Visual variables make up "the world of images" - Jacques Bertin
* This is a bit of a nebulous area. Attributes can be preattentive in some contexts but not in others
* Your choice can depend a lot on context and other constraints
  * color on maps rather than length

---

### Example 1: Length vs. Angle

### Example 2: The problem with area

<img class="img" src="materials/Week 1/Slides/resources/class2_31.jpg">
<div class="source">Source: http://blog.fastfedora.com/2011/01/2011-state-of-the-union-visualizations.html</div>

Notes:

* Area is proportional to the square of the radius
* Making the obvious change here avoids bias, but makes it less clear that the largest circle is actually almost as large as the rest combined.

### Example 3: Bars aren't always king

<div class="source">Source: https://www.originlab.com/doc/Tutorials/3D-Bar-FlatSurf</div>

Notes:

* A simple choropleth map would have been more effective

---

## Practice your eye

## Use your best judgment

Notes:

* Look out for data visualization in the wild and critique it
* Think about whether there would be a clearer way
* Learn to trust your gut--not all visualizations will be obviously good or bad
